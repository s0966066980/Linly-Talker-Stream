## Introduction

## Why Linly-Talker-Stream?

Linly-Talker-Stream is the **real-time streaming architecture version** of [Linly-Talker](https://github.com/Kedreamix/Linly-Talker). It upgrades traditional turn-based QA into a more human-like **full-duplex conversational system**:

- 🎤 **Listen while speaking**: user speech and avatar playback can run in parallel.
- ⚡ **Low-latency transport**: real-time audio/video transmission via WebRTC.
- ✋ **Barge-in and interruption support**: more natural conversational rhythm.
- 🧩 **Modular multimodal pipeline**: ASR / LLM / TTS / Avatar modules are replaceable and extensible.

If you want to build AI assistants, digital human front desks, interactive guides, or live Q&A scenarios, this project can serve as a practical real-time interaction engineering baseline.

> On top of Linly-Talker’s multimodal pipeline (ASR / LLM / TTS / Avatar), this project references [LiveTalking](https://github.com/lipku/LiveTalking) for real-time communication design and performs a **streaming pipeline refactor**. Continuous optimization is planned.

## Demos & Showcase

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Linly-Talker demo video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rN4y1a76x/
> - Linly-Talker-Stream demo video: **TODO (to be added)**

Linly-Talker-Stream is positioned as the “real-time streaming version,” reusing and extending [Linly-Talker](https://github.com/Kedreamix/Linly-Talker)’s multimodal digital human capabilities:

- Project: [Linly-Talker](https://github.com/Kedreamix/Linly-Talker)
- If this project helps you, please also star [**Linly-Talker**](https://github.com/Kedreamix/Linly-Talker) to support upstream development.

**System Architecture**

**Web UI Preview**

## Roadmap (TODO)

- [ ] Introduce **Omni multimodality**, evolving from fixed `ASR + LLM + TTS` into a more complete end-to-end pipeline.
- [ ] Add server-side **VAD** to improve endpoint detection, interruption handling, and turn control stability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is under active iteration. PRs and Issues are welcome.

## Highlights

- **WebRTC real-time streaming playback** with low latency in browsers.
- **Full-duplex interaction (currently available)**: supports speaking and listening simultaneously. The current full-duplex implementation mainly relies on **browser speech recognition** (with built-in VAD/endpoint detection) for user-side speech detection and transcription, while avatar audio/video is continuously streamed via WebRTC.
- **Switchable avatar engines** via configuration:
  - `wav2lip` (2D)
  - `musetalk` (2D)
  - `ernerf` (3D)
  - `talkinggaussian` (3D)
- **Modular architecture** with isolated dependencies for on-demand installation and extension.

### Real-Time Interaction Pipeline

1. Browser captures microphone/camera input.
2. Speech enters the ASR and conversation pipeline.
3. LLM generates response text.
4. TTS outputs synthesized speech stream.
5. Avatar engine drives lip-sync and renders video.
6. WebRTC sends generated streams back to the browser in real time.

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.10+
- **Node.js**: 16+
- **uv**: recommended Python package manager ([installation docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
- **Browser**: Chrome / Edge recommended (remote microphone access usually requires HTTPS)

---

## Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# 1) Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Kedreamix/Linly-Talker-Stream.git
cd Linly-Talker-Stream

# 2) One-click environment setup (auto install uv + create .venv + install dependencies)
bash scripts/setup-env.sh wav2lip

# 3) Configure API key (default using Alibaba Cloud Bailian's Qwen-plus interface)
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# 4) One-click start backend + frontend
bash scripts/start-all.sh config/config_wav2lip.yaml
```

Open in browser: `http://localhost:3000`

> **Notes**
> - Supported avatars: `wav2lip`, `musetalk`, `ernerf`, `talkinggaussian`
> - DashScope API key application: [Alibaba Cloud Bailian Console](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com) (free quota available)
> - For detailed installation of uv / Node.js, see [FAQ.md](./FAQ.md)

---

## Manual Installation Example (wav2lip)

```bash
# Backend dependencies
uv venv --python 3.10.19
uv sync
uv pip install -e src/avatars/wav2lip/

# Frontend dependencies
cd web && npm install && cd ..

# Environment variable
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Start services
bash scripts/start-all.sh config/config_wav2lip.yaml
```

### Generate HTTPS Certificates (Recommended)

Microphone access for remote usage requires HTTPS:

```bash
bash scripts/create_ssl_certs.sh
```

Then set `app.ssl: true` in config and access with `https://localhost:3000`.

### Install Other Avatar Modules

```bash
# TalkingGaussian
uv pip install -e src/avatars/talkinggaussian/
uv pip install -e src/avatars/talkinggaussian/submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization/ --no-build-isolation
uv pip install -e src/avatars/talkinggaussian/submodules/simple-knn/ --no-build-isolation
uv pip install -e src/avatars/talkinggaussian/gridencoder/ --no-build-isolation

# MuseTalk (requires additional dependencies and post-processing)
uv pip install chumpy==0.70 --no-build-isolation
uv pip install -e src/avatars/musetalk/
uv run mim install mmengine
uv run mim install mmcv==2.2.0 --no-build-isolation
uv run mim install mmdet==3.1.0
uv run mim install mmpose==1.3.2
bash scripts/post_musetalk_install.sh
```

### Optional Qwen3 speech engines

Qwen3-ASR and Qwen3-TTS run locally and do not require an API key. Install their
official inference packages, then choose them in **Settings → Voice**. The first
apply downloads the selected model and runs a real warm-up/preview before saving.

```bash
bash scripts/setup-qwen-speech.sh
```

The script creates an isolated `.venv-qwen-speech` so Qwen's recent Transformers
pins do not replace the versions used by the avatar stack. The 0.6B checkpoints
are the recommended starting point. CUDA is strongly recommended; CPU inference
is available but considerably slower.

For Base voice cloning/reference-audio preprocessing, also install the system
`sox` package if the setup script prints a warning.

## Startup Methods

### A. Start Backend and Frontend Separately

```bash
# Backend
bash scripts/start-backend.sh config/config_wav2lip.yaml
# or
uv run python src/server/app.py --config config/config_wav2lip.yaml

# Frontend
bash scripts/start-frontend.sh config/config_wav2lip.yaml
```

### B. Start with One Command

```bash
bash scripts/start-all.sh config/config_wav2lip.yaml
```

Default ports:
- Backend: `http://localhost:8010`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`

---

## Configuration

All configs are in `config/*.yaml`. Common fields:

- `app.listenport`: backend port (default `8010`)
- `app.ssl`: whether to enable HTTPS (recommended for remote recording)
- `model.type`: avatar type (`wav2lip` / `musetalk` / `ernerf` / `talkinggaussian`)
- `tts.type`: keyless TTS engine (`edgetts`, `gpt-sovits`, `cosyvoice`, `fishtts`, `indextts2`, or `xtts`)
- `asr.mode`: `browser` (recommended) / `server` / `auto`
- `llm.*`: LLM config (defaults to Qwen-plus on DashScope)

Default config reads:

```bash
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: LLM features require an API key from [Alibaba Cloud Bailian](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com), which provides free usage quota.

## Config Presets

The repository provides runnable config presets with modular installation:

| Status | Config File | Avatar Type | 2D/3D | One-Click Setup Command |
|------|---------|-----------|------|------------|
| ✅ | `config/config_wav2lip.yaml` | wav2lip | 2D | `bash scripts/setup-env.sh wav2lip` |
| ✅ | `config/config_musetalk.yaml` | musetalk | 2D | `bash scripts/setup-env.sh musetalk` |
| ✅ | `config/config_talkinggaussian.yaml` | talkinggaussian | 3D | `bash scripts/setup-env.sh talkinggaussian` |
| ⬜ | `config/config_ernerf.yaml` | ernerf | 3D | `bash scripts/setup-env.sh ernerf` |

Recommended engine switch procedure:

1. Install the target avatar module.
2. Start with matching `config/config_*.yaml`.
3. Verify model and asset paths in the config.
